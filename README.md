# SkeetRAT ( Name will be changed )
A private RAT with many features.


SkeetRAT is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that I have been developing for around 8 months.

The stub is fully modular, meaning none of the features are directly built into the stub code.

This significantly reduces the stub size and AV detections.

SkeetRAT has support for both .NET stubs (.NET stub is 7kb), and native stubs (Like 500 kb, no dependencies required on target pc).

Features:
Fun

    Chat
    Play Sound
    Text to speech
    Screen fuck

Surveillance

    2 Way Microphone (listen, speak)
    Remote Desktop
    InfoStealer
    Live Keylogger
    Beta hVNC

System

    Enable / Disable Task manager, CMD
    Reverse Shell CMD, Powershell
    System Information
    File explorer (Upload & Download multiple files at once, delete files, execute files)

Stub

    Kill
    Relaunch
    Uninstall

Essential (On connect to retreive data (Fully modular stub so that functionality isnt built in))

    Active Window Exfil
    Check privileges
    Get desktop name / user name
    Get IP
    Persistence module

SkeetRAT is designed to handle multiple clients and provide a range of surveillance and system control features, while maintaining low resource usage on both Server and Clients computers (1% > CPU and Memory usage).

The project is ongoing, and updates are frequently posted.
